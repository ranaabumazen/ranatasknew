in this task I have created six files and two scripts
in the first script (script.sh) i wrote commands and store the results in files for
each (disk,cpu and memory)
so initially i wrote command to show some info about disk(usage and available )
for the used file system with showing the date and time
so i used the df command then i use the awk with NR to filter the result of df


then i wrote a command to show the used and free memory by using free -m
command then i use awk command to filter the result of free -m to show only free and 
used memory and i show the date and time

then i used the mpstat -P ALL command to show some info about cpu 
such as used and idle and i used the awk command to filter the cpu's results 




in the second script (scriptavg.sh)
in this script i wrote commands to calculate the averages of info in each of 
cpu ,disk ,mem files 
awk '{totalm +=$1;countm++ }END {print totalm/countm}' to calculate the avearges of each of them

i used the crontab to excute the jobs
